\title{
Joint Modeling of Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data in R
}

\description{
This package fits shared parameter models for the joint modeling of normal longitudinal responses and event times 
under a maximum likelihood approach. Various options for the survival model and optimization/integration algorithms are 
provided.

The package has a single model-fitting function called \code{\link{jointModel}}, which accepts as main arguments a linear
mixed effects object fit returned by function \code{lme()} of package \pkg{nlme}, and a survival object fit returned 
by either function \code{coxph()} or function \code{survreg()} of package \pkg{survival}. In addition, the \code{method}
argument of \code{jointModel()} specifies the type of the survival submodel to be fitted and the type of the numerical 
integration technique; available options are:
\describe{
    \item{\code{"Cox-PH-GH"}}{the time-dependent version of a proportional hazards model with unspecified baseline hazard 
        function. The Gauss-Hermite integration rule is used to approximate the required integrals. (This option 
        corresponds to the joint model proposed by Wulfsohn and Tsiatis, 1997)}
    \item{\code{"weibull-PH-GH"}}{the Weibull model under the proportional hazards formulation. The Gauss-Hermite 
        integration rule is used to approximate the required integrals.}
    \item{\code{"weibull-AFT-GH"}}{the Weibull model under the accelerated failure time formulation. The Gauss-Hermite 
        integration rule is used to approximate the required integrals.}
    \item{\code{"piecewise-PH-GH"}}{a proportional hazards model with a piecewise constant baseline risk function. The Gauss-Hermite 
        integration rule is used to approximate the required integrals.}    
    \item{\code{"spline-PH-GH"}}{a proportional hazards model, in which the log baseline hazard is 
        approximated using B-splines. The Gauss-Hermite integration rule is used to approximate the required integrals.}
    \item{\code{"ch-Laplace"}}{an additive log cumulative hazard model, in which the log cumulative baseline hazard is 
        approximated using B-splines. A fully exponential Laplace approximation method is used to approximate the 
        required integrals (Rizopoulos et al., 2009).}
}
For all the above mentioned options (except the last one), a pseudo-adaptive Gauss-Hermite integration rule is also available
(Rizopoulos, 2012b). This is much faster than the classical Gauss-Hermite rule, and in several simulations it has been 
shown to perform equally well (though its performance is still under investigation).

The package also offers several utility functions that can extract useful information from fitted joint models. The most
important of those are included in the \bold{See also} section below.
